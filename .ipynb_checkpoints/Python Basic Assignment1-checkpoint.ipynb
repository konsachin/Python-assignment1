    "# Q1) Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a highly popular programming language, known for its versatility, ease of use, and wide range of applications. Here are some of the key features that contribute to its popularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability and Simplicity\n",
    "Clear Syntax: Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, which makes it easier to learn and understand.\n",
    "Less Code: Python often requires fewer lines of code to accomplish the same tasks compared to other languages like Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interpreted Language\n",
    "No Compilation Step: Python is an interpreted language, meaning code can be run as soon as it's written without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "Interactive Mode: Python supports an interactive mode which allows for interactive testing and debugging of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Versatility\n",
    "Multi-Paradigm: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast standard library and many third-party libraries, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from web development to scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portability\n",
    "Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python code can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and more, with little to no modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Science and Machine Learning\n",
    "Popular Libraries: Python is the language of choice for data science and machine learning, with powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.\n",
    "Visualization Tools: Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn make it easy to create visualizations and gain insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Automation and Scripting\n",
    "Automating Tasks: Python is commonly used for scripting to automate repetitive tasks and processes, from simple file manipulations to complex system administration tasks."

    "1)Control Flow: Keywords like if, else, elif, while, for, break, continue, and pass are used to control the flow of the program.\n",
    "2)Data Types and Structures: Keywords such as None, True, False, class, def, lambda, return, yield, and global are used to define data types, functions, and classes.\n",
    "3)Exception Handling: Keywords like try, except, finally, raise, assert, and with are used for handling exceptions and resource management.\n",
    "4)Logical and Arithmetic Operations: Keywords like and, or, not, is, and in are used for logical and membership operations.\n",
    "5)Context Management: Keywords like with are used to ensure proper acquisition and release of resources.\n",
